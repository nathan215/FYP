\section*{Three-Point Trilateration}

Given three points in a plane: 
\[ P_1(x_1, y_1), \quad P_2(x_2, y_2), \quad \text{and} \quad P_3(x_3, y_3) \]
and the distances from an unknown point \( P(x, y) \) to each of these three points are \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \) respectively, we can set up the following equations based on the Pythagorean theorem:

\begin{align*}
A) & \quad (x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 = r_1^2 \\
B) & \quad (x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2 \\
C) & \quad (x - x_3)^2 + (y - y_3)^2 = r_3^2
\end{align*}

Subtracting the first equation from the other two, we get the linear equations:

\begin{align*}
D) & \quad 2(x_2 - x_1)x + 2(y_2 - y_1)y = r_1^2 - r_2^2 + x_2^2 - x_1^2 + y_2^2 - y_1^2 \\
E) & \quad 2(x_3 - x_1)x + 2(y_3 - y_1)y = r_1^2 - r_3^2 + x_3^2 - x_1^2 + y_3^2 - y_1^2
\end{align*}

From \(D\) and \(E\), we solve for \(x\) and \(y\).

\section*{Overconstrained Trilateration}

When given more than three points and their distances to an unknown point, the system is overconstrained. This means it may not be possible to find a point that satisfies all the distance equations exactly. Therefore, we use a least squares method to find the point \( P(x, y) \) that minimizes the total squared error with respect to all given distances.

Given \( n \) points \( P_i(x_i, y_i) \) and their distances \( r_i \) to the unknown point, we formulate the equations:

\[ f_i(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2x_i x - 2y_i y + x_i^2 + y_i^2 - r_i^2 \]

The goal is to find \(x\) and \(y\) that minimize:

\[ S(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x, y)^2 \]

Using optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, we can minimize \( S(x, y) \) to determine the coordinates of point \( P \).
